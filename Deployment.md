PROPOSED AWS DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

This document outlines a potential strategy for deploying the app on AWS. It's a straightforward approach that if executed well would be production-ready, secure, and simple for a small team to manage. 

Core Components:

Application: My recommendation would be to run the app in a single Docker container, managed by AWS Fargate, since Fargate is serverless, so we wouldn't have to manage servers. The container would hold both the FastAPI backend and the built React frontend. 

Database: For the database, I would use Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. It's a managed service, so AWS handles things like backups and security patches. The database would be placed in a private network and not exposed to the internet. The current SQlite database serves its purpose well for a small project like this, but for a full production deployment PostgreSQL would be better suited. 

Traffic: An Application Load Balancer (ALB) could serve as the public entry point. It would handle all incoming traffic, manage SSL (HTTPS), and route requests to the Fargate container. That way Fargate can handle scaling as it needs to, and load will be distributed according to the available containers. 

CI/CD: A simple CI/CD pipeline could be set up with AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild, connected to the GitHub repo. Amazon ECR would be used to store the Docker images. But before scaling, it would be faster to keep the CI/CD process lightweight as the application evolved to be properly integrated with another app, as the core tool lends itself towards integrating as part of a separate app, whereas currently it exists as an isolated web server. 

The Workflow:

With this setup, the deployment process could be fully automated. We can imagine: 
A developer pushes new code to the main branch
-> This automatically triggers CodePipeline
-> CodeBuild then builds a new Docker image from the code and pushes it to the Amazon ECR repository
-> CodePipeline tells Fargate to deploy the new image, updating the running application with zero downtime

Simplified, Fargate handles the actual scaling, an ALB handles requests, RDS handles data, and CodeBuild+CodePipeline handles deployment from development state to production. 

This approach would result in a scalable and secure app without unnecessary complexity and management overhead.
